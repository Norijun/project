Barok is considered as one of the most popular komiks characters in the Philippines created by Filipino cartoonist Bert Sarile and Filipino comic book script writer Polly Rallanca in 1973. It is also means Sillano. A stone-age Philippine comic book character, Barok was described by Sarile as a lead character and one of the equivalents in the Philippine comic book industry of the American cartoon characters in The Flintstones. Barok was illustrated in komiks by Sarile as a “pre-historic caveman” who carried a “large club”.

Beerkada is a popular comic strip that appears regularly on The Philippine Star since 1998. Created by Lyndon Gregorio, the strips revolve around an eclectic group of friends as they try to survive college and post-college life. The name "Beerkada" is a portmanteau of "Beer", and "Barkada", a Filipino word for a close-knit group of friends.
