<p>Team Philippines pads lead in SEA Games gold medal race</p>
<p>
Margielyn Didal let her skating do the talking on the course for a Southeast Asian Games gold medal.
After that, she rattled off her mouth and used her victory to call out—to whoever would listen—for more support for the sport, which will be included in the Olympics for the first time when the Tokyo Games are held next year as the Philippines tries to end a century-long wait for its first gold medal there.
The 20-year-old Didal, a street vendor’s daughter who bankrolled P6 million after her Asian Games win last year in Jakarta, Indonesia, ruled the game of skate event and was later on joined by Daniel Ledermann for a golden double. The third medal came from Christiana Means, who made it a 1-2 for the Philippines by finishing second to Didal.
As of 8 p.m. Thursday, the Philippines already has a tally of 65-45-34 (gold-silver-bronze) to sustain its inexorable march to a first overall title since 2005 when it last hosted the Games. The Vietnamese have 31-35-41, while Indonesia, which remained in third spot, has 27-36-39.
